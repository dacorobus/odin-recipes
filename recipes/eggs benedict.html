    <img src="../images/eggsbenedict.jpg" alt="eggs benedict jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Start by making this simple recipe for hollandaise sauce (see the step-by-step photos, below).  Next, poach the eggs, warm the Canadian bacon, and toast the english muffin.  Finally, assemble your Eggs Benedict by placing the Canadian bacon on top of half of an english muffin.  Place a poached egg on top of the Canadian bacon, and smother the egg in hollandaise sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 English muffins</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>4 slices Canadian bacon</li>
        <li>Vinegar, just a splash</li>
        <li>4 Tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>4 egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice, or lime juice</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a small saucepan.  In a separate small bowl, beat the egg yolks.  Mix in lemon juice, whipping cream, and salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add a small spoonful of the hot melted butter to the egg mixture and stir well.  Repeat this process adding a spoonful at a time of hot butter to the egg mixture. (Adding the butter slowly, a spoonful at a time, will temper the eggs and ensure they don't curdle.</li>
        <li>Once the butter has been incorporated, pour the mixture back into the saucepan.  Cook on low heat, stirring constantly, for just 20-30 seconds.  Remove from heat and set aside.  It will thicken as it cools.  Stir well and add another splash of cream, if needed, to thin.</li>
    </ol>
