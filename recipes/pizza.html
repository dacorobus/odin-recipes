    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The following method I patched together from recipes in both <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743246268/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=simplyrecip02-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0743246268">Joy of Cooking</a> and Cook's Illustrated's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0936184744/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=simplyrecip02-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0936184744">The Best Recipe</a>.  The pizza dough recipe makes enough dough for two 10 to 12 inch pizzas.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cup (355ml) warm water (105 degrees F-115 degrees F)</li>
        <li>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 3/4 cups (490g) bread flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (omit if cooking pizza in a wood fired pizza oven</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Proof the yeast:</h3><p>Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer.  Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.</p><p>After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely.  The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.</p><p>(Note that if you are using "instant yeast" instead of "active yeast", no proofing is required.  Just add to the flour in the next step.)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Make and knead the pizza dough:</h3><p>Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute.  Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.</p><p>Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.</p><p>If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand.</p><p>The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch.  If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Let the dough rise:</h3><p>Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl.  Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.</p><p>At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise.  A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough.  A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with.</p><p>Cover the dough with plastic wrap.</p><p>for a quick rise, place the dough in a warm place (75 degrees F to 85 degrees F) for 1 1/2 hours.</p><p>For a medium rise, place the dough in a regular room temperature place (your kitchen counter will do fine) for 8 hours.  For a longer rise, chill the dough in the refrgerator for 24 hours (no more than 48 hours).</p><p>The longer the rise (to a point) the better the flavor the crust will have.</p>
