    <h1>Corn Chowder</h1>
    <img src="../images/cornchowder.jpeg" alt="corn chowder jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>a bowl of corn chowder is as satisfying in the height of fresh corn season in summer as it is in the depths of winter, when a bowl of chowder is just what you need to warm yourself up.  This quick and easy soup recipe highlights the taste of sweet summer corn, but since the vegetable is available virtually alll the time, you can (and should) make this chowder year-round.  Fresh corn offers the best flavor here, but use frozen corn if that is what is available.</p>
    <p>If you like, freeze corn at the end of summer so you have it available for this recipe in winter.  Cut the kernels off the cobs and freeze them separately.  Let the cobs simmer in the broth while the chowder cooks, to give it an extra boost of corn flavor.  Remove and discard the cobs when you are ready to serve.  Pureeing some of the corn kernels to stir into the simmering soup helps thicken it while deepening the corn flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>4 scallions, white bulbs and green tops chopped and reserved separately</li>
